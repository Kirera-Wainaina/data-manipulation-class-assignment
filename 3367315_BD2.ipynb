    "| Fail | You will fail if your code does not run or does not achieve even the basics of the task. You may also fail if you submit code without either comments or a text explanation of what the code does.|\n",
    "| Pass | To pass, you must submit sufficient working code to show that you have mastered the basics of the task, even if not everything works completely. You must include some justifications for your choice of methods, but without mentioning alternatives. |\n",
    "| Merit | For a merit, your code must be mostly correct, with only small problems or parts missing, and your comments must be useful rather than simply re-stating the code in English. Most choices for methods and structures should be explained and alternatives mentioned. |\n",
    "| Distinction | For a distinction, your code must be working, correct, and well commented and shows an appreciation of style, efficiency and reliability. All choices for methods and structures are concisely justified and alternatives are given well thought considerations. For a distinction, your work should be good enough to present to executives at the company.|\n",

    "### Academic Misconduct\n",

    "\n",
    "Plagiarism is presenting somebody else’s work as your own **and includes the use of artificial intelligence tools such as GPT or CoPilot**. Plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct and is taken very seriously by the University. Students found to have plagiarised work can have marks deducted and, in serious cases, even be expelled from the University. Do not submit any work that is not entirely your own.

    "You can add additional data if you need to - either download it or access it using `requests`. Produce working code to implement your ideas in as many cells as you need below. There is no single right answer, the aim is to simply show you are competent in using python for data analysis. Exactly how you do that is up to you.\n",
